You love web application development and you enjoy seeing businesses grow. You've been in the business for a few years now. You’ve done the whole startup thing and you're ready to find something a little more meaty. Working as one of many developers isn't appealing to you anymore and the commute to San Francisco isn't doing it for you either. You're ready to be part of a team, and you want to own the product vision. You love making great things used by people, not just creating code, but contributing and leading projects to success.
Helio has shown 20% quarter over quarter sales growth, and we need a senior engineer to shape and grow our Helio platform. Specifically we’re looking for a full stack engineer (Front-end -> Ruby on Rails -> Networking/AWS) who wants to own the vision. We're looking for a driven individual to push development forward, work with our active and passionate customers, and take Helio to the next level.
Who we are
We're a team of driven product designers who believe in rapid prototyping, researching on the fly and teaching people how to make better products. We've been around since 1998, creating world-class products that hundreds of millions of people actually use. We believe Design, with a capital ""D"", can change the world, and we’re making it happen. You’ll have the opportunity to build better products that solve problems and meet our customers needs.
We want to change the way people create products and services to bring behavioral data into everyday creative decisions.
What Your Day Will Look Like
Working closely with the team, you’ll spend time planning and developing on the roadmap. Some days you’ll be working on a new feature. Other days you will be deep into code, addressing architecture or fixing a tricky bug. All the while, working with the team to galvanize the momentum we’ve created with our customers.
You’ll work with our awesome team to learn Progressive Design — ZURB’s flagship design process — and how it applies to Helio. At the end of the day, you'll find that you are more than just a developer, you’re working with a world-class design organization, helping millions of people design for people and making a difference in the product community -- and that's pretty awesome.
What You Bring To The Table

5-10 years of development experience working in a startup, independent contractor, or similar environment.
Should be comfortable in the full stack (Front-end -> Ruby on Rails -> Networking/AWS). You’ll need a solid grasp of Ruby on Rails.
Very comfortable with SQL (We use PostgreSQL and MySQL).
Very comfortable with at least one modern front-end framework (React, VueJS, Angular). We use VueJS and AngularJS as well as Stimulus.
Should be familiar with common software design patterns (observer pattern, facade pattern) .
Should be familiar with server security updates, Ruby security patches, and support third party audits.
Familiarity with AWS (EC2/RDS/VPC/IAM/etc).
Familiarity with video encoding and prototyping tools.
Familiarity with CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deploy), we use CircleCI.
Familiarity with generating financial reports, participant payouts and dealing with GDPR requests for removal.

Other skills we’re looking for

Natural sense of curiosity, and maintains a strong point of view. You enjoy sharing your ideas and listening to the ideas of your teammates. You write well.
Experience delivering solid products over and over again.
An enthusiasm for coaching and teaching people on our team.

A little more about us
ZURB is a close-knit product design team based in Campbell, CA. We've been around since 1998, have helped more than 500 startups design some kick-ass online products and created many of our own products, like Foundation. Our customers range from large, well-known companies (Netflix, Hulu, eBay, Samsung, Mozilla, Facebook, Columbia) to start-ups. They all came to us because of our reputation for delivering killer ideas that work.

iPhone Photography School,Senior PHP/Laravel Developer: Your Dream Work Environment,Remote,https://jobs.github.com/positions/dd8ca676-e814-11e8-9ed0-16c6818d7db3,2018-11-14 13:55:40+00:00,"Attention Senior Backend Developers:
“Skyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment – While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase”
You’ve finally found it…
The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.
If you’re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!
But only if you keep reading.
iPhone Photography School is the world’s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.
On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.
Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.
To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.
8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School
1 - Solve Interesting Problems
Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.
This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.
We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.
The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.
2 - Work With A Clean Codebase
Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”
We don’t work like that.
We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.
This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.
3 - Endless Opportunities To Grow
You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.
We get how important growth is for developers.
Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.
Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.
4 - Get Expert Guidance
Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.
If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.
Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.
Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.
5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own Time
Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?
You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.
We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.
This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.
6 - Work From Anywhere In The World
We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!
If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.
7 - Stability You Can Count On
Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.
Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.
You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.
8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your Code
Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.
During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.
Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.
Here’s What We Expect From You…

You’re excellent at PHP
You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP
You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years
You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems
You want to participate in scrum teamwork
You have an excellent attention to detail

We use innovative technology, a scientific approach, and a deep understanding of markets to stay successful in our highly competitive field. We operate around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.
The markets in which we trade change rapidly, but our intellectual approach changes faster still. Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don't come to work wanting to leave. We come to work excited to test new theories, have thought-provoking discussions, and maybe sneak in a game of ping-pong or two. Keeping our culture casual and our employees happy is of paramount importance to us.
As Jane Street grows, the quality of the development tools we use matters more and more.  We increasingly work on the OCaml compiler itself: adding useful language features, fine-tuning the type system and improving the performance of the generated code. Alongside this, we also work on the surrounding toolchain, developing new tools for profiling, debugging, documentation and build automation.
We're looking to hire a developer with experience working on compilers to join us. That experience might be from working on a production compiler in industry or from working on research compilers in an academic setting. No previous experience with OCaml or functional programming languages is required.
We’re looking for candidates for both our London and New York offices. Benefits and compensation are highly competitive.

We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming.

We've got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world's largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you're interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there's no better place.
The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there's a lot of room for growth.

We seek developers who place a high value on continuous learning, and value diversity. If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you’ll be in great company.
Our goal is to leave our client teams functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside our clients’ development teams, as well as mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices.
We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is.
As a Strider, you’ll find a learning opportunity that’s unmatched. You will:

Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and has won Crain’s -Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.
Write high quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.
Immerse yourself in a learning journey that’s second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.
Mentor and be mentored. Learning weaves a thread through all that we do.

A Day In The Life of a Stride Software Engineer
You’ll co-locate and work onsite at your client (all are in NYC). We are proud to call the most outstanding tech teams in NYC our clients, ranging from funded startups to Fortune 500.
You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here’s how one day might unfold:
9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I’m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager’s take. We walk away with action items for next week’s one-on-one.
10am: Daily Standup. I’m at work at the client’s office. They’ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I’m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we’re off to code.
10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I’m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.
12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride
12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride’s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I’m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.
1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client’s office.
1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we’re retrospecting our last release. I’ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.
2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I’ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it’s been a huge career learning experience for me.
6pm: Leave for the Day. It’s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.
What you’ll be doing

Writing high quality code, and bringing a ‘teach a team to fish’ mentality to your project.
Embed with development teams in some of NYC’s most exciting companies to help them up their game and get stuff done.
Advocate for non-dogmatic Agile software development best practices like Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Improvement.
Be part of a cross functional team that includes Striders (likely 2-6 Strider engineers plus a product manager) and client employees (likely engineers and other tech roles).
Work with a variety of tech stacks, and a see a variety of tech teams. We embed with teams who write code in modern tech stacks such as Ruby on Rails, React, Angular, Python, Scala, Java8, Elixir, Node and more.

You’re a fit for Stride if you have:

3+ years of software development experience
Experience in multiple programming languages
Excitement to learn new languages and frameworks
Experience with TDD, story estimation, test writing, and pair programming

What you can expect from us:

Continuous learning on things that you are passionate about
Competitive Pay and Benefits (including Profit Sharing!)
Empowerment to work at a self-defined Sustainable Pace
No travel, all of our clients are located in NYC
$2,000 and up to two weeks of your time for self-directed professional development

We love Python and ElasticSearch on the server side and JavaScript, backbone.js, React, D3 and more on the client side.

Constructive,"Technology Team Lead, Design Agency for Social Impact",New York City,https://jobs.github.com/positions/df5b47be-d612-11e8-88f4-50633736745c,2018-10-22 15:56:13+00:00,"Constructive (https://constructive.co), a leading brand experience design & digital design agency that works exclusively with social impact organizations is looking for an outstanding technical expert and creative thinker to take over for our current Technology Team Lead, who will sadly be transitioning out of the role at the end of 2018 to live abroad.
If you’re an experienced technologist who wants to work on websites and products that are at the front of the field, knows how to architect and build complex websites, thrives on being a consultative, collaborative problem solver, and believes that the best digital experiences happen when strategy, technology, and design work together, then we’d love to hear from you. If you care deeply about issues like climate change, social justice, and economic equality—and want the work you do to make a meaningful positive impact on them—then we think you’ll love working with us and our clients.
##A bit about the role
Our Technology Team Lead needs a holistic understanding of modern web development techniques and infrastructure. They need experience building strong and scalable websites. They must thrive on being hands-on with development projects. They’ll need a leadership mindset, and must be capable of working on multi-disciplinary teams to communicate complex technological choices to non-developers.
That’s all fancy job-posting language for: you really know your stuff and don’t have a big ego, you take responsibility for the quality of our work and the growth of your team, you still like to get your hands dirty with code, and you’re an effective collaborator—especially with people who don’t understand technology as well as you do.
##A bit about us
We’re a diverse, close-knit bunch who are serious about having fun producing exceptional work. We play to win—for our clients, for ourselves, and for the world. We’ve got each other’s backs. We’ve got high expectations and we’ve got the work ethic to match them. We’re all together in the same open office, so there’s music and joking mixed-in with being heads-down on work.
##A bit about diversity
We believe strongly that diversity is one of our greatest strengths—that the more perspectives we bring to the mix, the better we are as people and the better partner we are for our clients. So, in considering if Constructive is a good fit for you, know that all we care about is that you’re qualified to do the job, share most or all of our values, and want to be here. These are the things we’ll be evaluating for every applicant—and if you meet those and add to our diversity, all the better.
##What we need you to do extremely well
This role combines technology team leadership and hands-on development, emphasizing one or the other at any given time. We’ll need you to have strong demonstrated success having done all or most of these things for at least 3-5 years—and a passion for doing them well.


Provide strong technical leadership—both for our internal team of developers, strategists, and designers; and for our clients and occasional external dev partners.
Manage and mentor junior developers—two in-house developers, one ongoing external partner, and any additional developers when project load requires it.

Guide development team and our company on planning, prioritizing, mitigating risks, and balancing technical debt to meet project milestones so that we deliver exceptional work that meets expectations.

Work with stakeholders to define strategic goals and the context in which they need to be met, gather requirements, and produce technical documentation that makes it very clear how technology will help achieve them.

Develop requirements, specifications, and architecture to document what we’re building and what’s been built.

Lead development of ambitious digital products, serving as the point person for both the end-to-end process and the outcomes we deliver, aligning our work with Constructive’s broader strategic position as a leading brand experience design firm.

Be a hands-on developer who takes on specific aspects of complex jobs or plays a lead developer role on a project when needed.

Review code and provide feedback on work done by other developers; oversee the UAT and QA processes in coordination with project managers.

Improve best practices, recommend tools, and build frameworks that make our work more efficient, effective, and technically front-of field.

Be the face of Constructive’s technical expertise throughout client engagements, in the development community, and when needed in our sales cycle.

Contribute to developing proposals and estimates for technical projects, particularly those with complex requirements.

Lead vetting and hiring of web developers and external development partners.

Be a team player who knows how to lead, has a bias towards listening, takes serious pride in their work, and is always looking for our process and results to be better the next time out.
It definitely helps if you also have a good sense of humor

##Expertise that’s important in our work
Right now, these are the specific technologies and tasks that are essential to our work. We’ll need you to have about 5 years of experience in most of these things, and we’re very open to new ideas on which specific technologies and tools can improve on what we have.

Expert Wordpress & Drupal development (Minimum 5 years of experience)
Expert front-end development experience
Strong experience with Webpack / Gulp / SCSS
